Changes made:
1) Added weather API driver (Open‑Meteo, no API key):
   - src/api/weatherDriver.ts

2) New weather widget UI that consumes the driver and renders in grid cell (1,1):
   - src/components/WeatherWidget.tsx

3) Home page now shows a dashboard grid and injects WeatherWidget at (1,1):
   - src/pages/Home.tsx (replaced content)

Notes:
- The driver exposes fetchWeatherStandard(lat, lon, label?) → StandardWeather.
- If no coords are given, it tries browser geolocation with a fallback to New York, NY.
- StandardWeather has normalized field names: tempC, tempF, conditionCode, condition, windKph, humidity, updatedAt, locationLabel, source.
- Styling assumes Tailwind (existing project already uses Tailwind-like classes).
